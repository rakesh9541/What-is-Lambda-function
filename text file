What is lambda function?

After you make your Lambda work, it is consistently prepared to run 
when set off, like a formula in a spreadsheet. Each function
incorporates your code just as related design data, including the
capacity name and asset prerequisites. Lambda capacities
are "stateless," with no bias to the hidden foundation, so Lambda
can quickly dispatch however many duplicates of the capacity on a
case-by-case basis to scale to the pace of approaching occasions. 

After you transfer your code to AWS Lambda,
you can connect your function with explicit AWS assets, 
for example, a specific Amazon S3 can, Amazon DynamoDB table,
Amazon Kinesis stream, or Amazon SNS warning. Then, at that point,
when the function changes, Lambda will execute your function and compute resources as needed.
